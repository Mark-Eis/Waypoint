# Waypoint (development version)

* Format S3 method for `"waypoints"` objects `usenames` argument now works.

* Print S3 methods for `"coords"` and `"waypoints"` objects improved when 'max' / getOption("max.print") is exceeded.

* Validate S3 methods for `"coords"` and `"waypoints"` objects now have `force` argument signifying whether to perform full _de novo_ revalidation or simply check existing "valid" attributes.

# Waypoint 1.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
